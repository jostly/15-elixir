# 15 Exercises to Know A Programming Language
## Elixir

Excercises in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) according to the instructions in [15 Exercises to Know A Programming Language](http://www.knowing.net/index.php/2006/06/16/15-exercises-to-know-a-programming-language-part-1/)

Seems the description of the Haar wavelets for exercise 2 is wrong, or at least unclear; I found a better explanation in [these lecture notes](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kyros/courses/320/Lectures.2013s/lecture.2013s.10.pdf), though the results I get from employing the latter algorithm are not consistent with the ones given for exercise 2.
